Mean Median and Mode | <a href="https://iridescent-bunny-fddeae.netlify.app/">DEMO</a>

1. User Registration , User login and fill the form to calculate the mean, median and mode for the data inputs.
2. Here I have used Local storage to store the user registration and login details instead of PHP and MySQL.
3. I have used 'display:none' to hide pages and displayed other pages by 'display:block' as user clicks submit and login buttons.
4. Used flexbox in CSS for aligning input forms.
5. Used some linear gradient taken from google makes it look cool.
6. Finally 5 data inputs are taken from user and calculates mean, median and mode for those 5 numbers.
